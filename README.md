I'm taking ages to get through this linux terminal tutorial.
I'm taking a break to write this just to see if I can remember how to update it on my own. 
My head hurts, I might not finish the linux one, let alone the bash as well, by tomorrow. 
Then again, I never sleep anymore, so who knows. 
it took me forever just to remember and look up how to stage and commit this again, wow.
