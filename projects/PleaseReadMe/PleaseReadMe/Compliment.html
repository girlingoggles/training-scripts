	<p>Everything I do-
<br/>is a compliment to you. 
<br/>You don't know it, 
<br/>but you gave me the courage
<br/>to think better of myself.
<br/>you inspired me
<br/>to remember who I was
<br/>before I knew I knew I was lost.
<br/>You, unknowingly, 
<br/>reminded me 
<br/>That I am better
<br/>than I give myself credit for.
<br/>That I am stronger 
<br/>than I think I am.
<br/>That I am smarter
<br/>than I had let myself be. 
<br/>Thank you, 
<br/>for letting me see you
<br/>and remember who I can be.
<br/>Thank you,
<br/>for making me realize I can
<br/>go back in time and start over.
<br/>Not with everything,
<br/>but with the things
<br/>that used to matter to me
<br/>that sparked the fire in me
<br/>that had dimmed with ridicule
<br/>and judgement over time. 
<br/>Thank you,
<br/>For making me question myself
<br/>second-guess what I want
<br/>let me become okay with
<br/>being myself again. 
<br/>Who I choose to become
<br/>is my choice. 
<br/>But, saying that,
<br/>everything I do- 
<br/>is a compliment to you.
<br/>Thank you.</p>
