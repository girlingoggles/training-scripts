I've learned how to say thank you
in a hundred different ways
but none of them is good enough
for the feelings i'd like to convey

There's no explaining the depth of my gratitude
to you, who helped me stand up again
how deeply every word etched into my mind
and helped remind, led me to find
who I am again

It might not mean much to you
but thank you and thank you and 
thank you
for being you

Though overall it's a thankless task
as I have no way to thank you enough
You let me hold your hand 
and you held me and let me cry

You were the gentlest soul I could ask for
the softest person to hug
A stable rock in the raging river
that acted as my life raft

If I could only show you somehow
the changes you've made within
if I could only tell you somehow
how wonderful you've been

I'll keep trying again and again
but for all I can say is
thank you and thank you and 
thank you
for being you
