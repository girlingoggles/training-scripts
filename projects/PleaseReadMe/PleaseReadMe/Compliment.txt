Everything I do-
is a compliment to you. 
You don't know it, 
but you gave me the courage
to think better of myself.
you inspired me
to remember who I was
before I knew I knew I was lost.
You, unknowingly, 
reminded me 
That I am better
than I give myself credit for.
That I am stronger 
than I think I am.
That I am smarter
than I had let myself be. 
Thank you, 
for letting me see you
and remember who I can be.
Thank you,
for making me realize I can
go back in time and start over.
Not with everything,
but with the things
that used to matter to me
that sparked the fire in me
that had dimmed with ridicule
and judgement over time. 
Thank you,
For making me question myself
second-guess what I want
let me become okay with
being myself again. 
Who I choose to become
is my choice. 
But, saying that,
everything I do- 
is a compliment to you.
Thank you.
