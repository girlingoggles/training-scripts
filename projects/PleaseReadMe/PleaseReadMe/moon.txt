I thought once, 
to think of you as the sun
bright and warm as summer
encouraging me to grow. 
Everyone compares someone,
some days, to the sun. 
Finding gentleness and 
happiness in the hot,
blistering summer heat.
I did.
But now, 
I think of you as the moon,
reserved, watchful, quiet,
a light in the dark of night.
The moon is much kinder
than the harsh, brilliant sun.
You leave no burns, 
no scars, start no fires.
On cloudy days,
losing your light 
means I lose my way
and I get scared
and frustrated
and feel all alone.
But on those clear nights
when you shine brightest,
I can see into forever
and feel alive.
The moon is a mystery,
one I haven't yet understood.
And you are kind,
kinder than I ever deserved. 
Like the moon,
you are gifted with 
the keeping of secrets
and bringing hope.
I thought once,
to think of you as the sun.
but you are the moon
shining in my darkness
and showing me the way.
