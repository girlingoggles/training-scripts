I am not yout priority and that's okay
Maybe I even get in your way
I wouldn't if I knew
But I don't know what I should so
I misstep at every turn- I know it
But I cannot see the road before me
I would follow yours if you would only let me
But that is asking too much I feel 
Lost, is one way to put me
In want of your guidance I feel is wanting too much
I cannot want from you, you are much too precious to me to take pieces and keep them for myself 
I want to give pieces to you to flourish and thrive and I don't 
know how to give you those pieces in a way you can use then so I give you what I can.
I give you everything you ask for that I can understand but I am 
Lost, is one way to put it
Because I do not know if I am 
your way or in your way and if
you care when I am gone or if I should just
Go, and find somewhere that wants me
To be there, not just to give pieces because I don't know how
else to talk to you and have you hear me
I just want you to
Hear me, when I am asking for help
I know I am selfish wanting so much and trying to want so little but trying to find my place
in a world I don't always understand is hard and you are the person I 
wish I could be so I look at you and I try to reach you and 
you are so much farther ahead that my head is
Under water and I can't swim fast enough and I can't breathe fast enough and the distance
between us is maybe growing or 
my vision is blurring and I keep swimming and hearing 
Your voice, in my head, telling me
what I should do but I don't understand because that voice isn't the real you, and the real you
has gone to bed hours ago and I sit here and think why am I so 
Lost, without you?
