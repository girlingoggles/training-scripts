You might not be perfect
but you're perfect for me
we complement each other 
like the sun and the rain
can't have one without the other
not in the same way

and of course I'm just swell on my own
but a little bit of your light goes a long way
when I'm feeling alone

You may not see what I see in you
But a little bit of your light
goes a long way
when I'm feeling alone

you may not see what I see in you
but there's more truth in my eyes than blindness 
the rose tinted glasses never made it on my face
and all I see is you

your perfect imperfections,
not quite Adonis but better if you're asking me
It's not a deification
maybe a little objectification
you have room for improvement but so do I
you're not quite perfect but neither am I

when I look at you, i see a reflection os me,
the better person that I want to be
you may not be perfect but you're perfect for me
