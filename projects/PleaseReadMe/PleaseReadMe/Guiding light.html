<p>I'm sorry I made you my guiding light
<br/>to turn to in times of need
<br/>when I feel lost in the world and uncertain
<br/>I ask imaginary you what you think I should do
<br/>
<br/>It doesn't always work, but I'm trying
<br/>to be my best self and do
<br/>what I think you would tell me to do
<br/>
<br/>And Im trying but I mess up and I can see
<br/>you get upset when I don't do what I know I should
<br/>Your anger when my stubbornness won't let me listen
<br/>
<br/>I try not to disappoint the you inside my head
<br/>even though I think he's stricter
<br/>and has higher expectations of what I should do
<br/>Regularly I fail, but I keep trying
<br/>I just want to be myself
<br/>and it so happens to be that
<br/>that's exactly who you want me to be
<br/>regardless of how much I've struggled
<br/>
<br/>if it sometimes seems like it's not me
<br/>but you know me better than I know myself
<br/>I feel it
<br/>if you didn't, you wouldn't care at all
<br/>and yet I remember
<br/>how you wouldn't just let me fall
<br/>
<br/>When I'm lost in the woods I look for Orion
<br/>when I'm lost in my thoughts I search for you
<br/>you're both there to guide me in my times of need
<br/>Neither of you has steered me wrong yet
<br/>
<br/>My compass needle pointing north, to you
<br/>and I only hope that one day I can earn
<br/>the forgiveness of the real you.</p>
