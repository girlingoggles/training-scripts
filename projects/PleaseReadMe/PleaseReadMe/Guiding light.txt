I'm sorry I made you my guiding light
to turn to in times of need
when I feel lost in the world and uncertain
I ask imaginary you what you think I should do

It doesn't always work, but I'm trying
to be my best self and do
what I think you would tell me to do

And Im trying but I mess up and I can see
you get upset when I don't do what I know I should
Your anger when my stubbornness won't let me listen

I try not to disappoint the you inside my head
even though I think he's stricter
and has higher expectations of what I should do
Regularly I fail, but I keep trying
I just want to be myself
and it so happens to be that
that's exactly who you want me to be
regardless of how much I've struggled

if it sometimes seems like it's not me
but you know me better than I know myself
I feel it
if you didn't, you wouldn't care at all
and yet I remember
how you wouldn't just let me fall

When I'm lost in the woods I look for Orion
when I'm lost in my mind/thoughts I search for you
you're both there to guide me in my times of need
Neither of you has steered me wrong yet

My compass needle pointing north, to you
and I only hope that one day I can earn
the forgiveness of the real you.
