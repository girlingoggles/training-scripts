I watch the pathways splinter and realign, what seemed clear as day is no longer my way. 
I tread along the narrow seams before the fork begins, hesitant to step too far from my dreams.
I see the valleys shift and form into new ideas and open doors.
Where abject chaos waited, sits careful thought instead. 
Where fear held my heart, now courage warms it. 
Where I trembled at the world, now I face the sun.
I tread along the narrow seams before the fork begins, hesitant to step too far from my dreams.
But dreams are everlasting and wait for their man, 
I will stumble, I will fall, yet in the end
I know I'll get myself there. 
I may jump my path, forge another, get lost along the way
but my future is almost clear as day. 
Let go of the past, embrace the unknown
Nature will run its course, let it sweep you along
and make sure you take your right turn
