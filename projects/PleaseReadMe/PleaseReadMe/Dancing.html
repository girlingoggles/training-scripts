<p>I don't need you but I want you
<br/>Dancing in the night next to me
<br/>pressed close and holding tighly
<br/>as the music goes right through me
<br/>and the ocean breeze tickles lightly
<br/>
<br/>I don't need you but I want you
<br/>Dancing in the night next to me
<br/>the fire of the last light
<br/>the heat of the sand 
<br/>the movement of the very land
<br/>
<br/>I don't need you but I want you
<br/>Dancing in the night next to me
<br/>swaying together in harmony
<br/>laughing at each other's company
<br/>forgetting there's a world out there
<br/>
<br/>I don't need you but I want you
<br/>Dancing in the night next to me
<br/>your hands in mine, entwined
<br/>your heart beats, your words sweet
<br/>the music tying us together</p>
