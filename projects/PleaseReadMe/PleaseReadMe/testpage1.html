		<h1>What's this blog?</h1>
		<p>Some crazy girl went on an adventure, and when her visa ran out, she went on an even bigger adventure. That blog is a partial chronicle of her travels. It's widely boring.</p>
		<h2>Should I read it?</h2>
		<p class="faded">Honestly, best not. It's not exactly been upkept or updated in over 8 months. Everest is why. It's hard to write about mountains that resonate with the energy of the depths of the earth.</p>
		<h2>So why does it exist?</h2>
		<p>Someone asked her to write it. But she sucks at it, which is why it's rarely updated. It's too tedious to find the right words to describe adventure.</p>
		<h3>Is this goodbye then?</h3>
		<p>No, never. She doesn't say goodbye, only "See you later" or- only sometimes- "See you soon"</p>
