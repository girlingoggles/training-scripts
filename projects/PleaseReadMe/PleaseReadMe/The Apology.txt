the weight of the world rests on your shoulders
but what am I, but a bird learning to fly?

You have goals and hopes and plans and such
and I am a child who dreams too much

But I find joy in every corner of the world
Every cloud is my silver lining
and though I may not understand as much as you do
I still wish to sit by you and learn it

Of course I hold you in the deepest respects
even though I don't know how to show it
I always try my best to make up for my mistakes
and I see that it's not enough to forgive

and I don't mind yet
that you've hardened your heart against me
I am the worst of myself and I'm trying
and I see how my struggle is showing
But I promise I'm growing

I don't need your love or affection
just the guiding light you provide
the beacon of hope I see up ahead
The future I want to give myself

For in you I see the strength that I'm lacking
and in you I see the kindness I've been afraid to show
You are the anchor to my mind's raging hurricane
and someday I know the skies will turn blue
